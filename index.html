<h1>Isabelle Cordova - Journal Entry Week 9</h1>
<p>I remember taking my first computer science class in high school and tinkering around with HTML and CSS. Flash forward 5 years and my skills haven’t improved that much - but I’m up for the challenge! I’m a strong advocate for web development literacy, and I think that everyone should have at least a baseline understanding of how websites operate behind the scenes. That being said, I definitely have a long way to go in my web development journey. Reading my peers’ discussion posts is fascinating because we come from such varied backgrounds: some of us have a solid gasp on coding, some are just starting out (I fall primary into the latter), while others come from more traditionally artistic backgrounds.</p>
